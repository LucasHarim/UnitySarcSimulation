Unity scene and scripts of the NoFire Squad Project to the [2nd SARC-BARINet competition][link_sarc_page].


This Unity project consists of a scene and scripts to illustrate some phases
of the mission proposed. **The physics-based simulation was performed in Gazebo and can be
found in the repository of the SEMEAR Group**, [Grupo-SEMEAR-USP/SARC2022][link_noFireSquad_repo].
